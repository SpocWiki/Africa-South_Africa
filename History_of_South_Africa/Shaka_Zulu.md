> Shaka kaSenzangakhona (c. 1787–24 September 1828), also known as Shaka (the) Zulu (Zulu pronunciation: [ˈʃaːɠa]) and Sigidi kaSenzangakhona, 
> was the king of the Zulu Kingdom from 1816 to 1828. 
> One of the most influential monarchs of the Zulu, 
> he ordered wide-reaching reforms that reorganized the military into a formidable force.
>
> King Shaka was born in the lunar month of uNtulikazi (July) in 1787, 
> in Mthonjaneni, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. 
> The son of the Zulu King Senzangakhona kaJama, he was spurned as an illegitimate son. 
> 
> Shaka spent part of his childhood in his mother's settlements, 
> where he was initiated into an ibutho lempi (fighting unit/regiment), 
> serving as a warrior under Inkosi Dingiswayo.
>
> King Shaka refined the ibutho military system with the Mthethwa Paramountcy's support 
> over the next several years. 
> 
> He forged alliances with his smaller neighbours to counter Ndwandwe raids from the north. 
> The initial Zulu maneuvers were primarily defensive, 
> as King Shaka preferred to apply pressure diplomatically, 
> with an occasional strategic assassination. 
> 
> His reforms of local society built on existing structures. 
> Although he preferred social and propagandistic political methods, 
> he also engaged in several battles.
>
> King Shaka's reign coincided with the start of the Mfecane/Difaqane ("upheaval"/"crushing"), 
> a period of devastating warfare and chaos in southern Africa between 1815 and 1840 
> that depopulated the region. 
> 
> His role in the Mfecane/Difaqane is controversial. 
> 
> He was assassinated by his half-brothers, 
> King Dingane and Prince Mhlangana and Mbopha kaSithayi.
