> The first modern humans are believed to have inhabited South Africa more than 100,000 years ago. 
> 
> South Africa's first known inhabitants have been collectively referred to as the Khoisan, the Khoekhoe and the San. 
> Starting in about 400 AD, these groups were then joined by the Bantu ethnic groups 
> who migrated from Western and Central Africa during what is known as the Bantu expansion. 
> These Bantu groups were mainly limited to the area north of the Soutpansberg 
> and the northeastern part of South Africa until the later Middle Iron Age (AD 1000-1300), 
> after which they started migrating south into the interior of the country.
>
> European exploration of the African coast began in the late 14th century 
> when Portugal sought an alternative route to the Silk Road to China. 
> During this time, Portuguese explorers traveled down the west African Coast, 
> detailing and mapping the coastline and in 1488 they rounded the Cape of Good Hope. 
> 
> The Dutch East India Company established a trading post in Cape Town 
> under the command of Jan van Riebeeck in April 1652, 
> mostly Dutch workers who settled at the Cape became known as the Free Burghers 
> and gradually established farms in the Dutch Cape Colony. 
> 
> Following the Invasion of the Cape Colony by the British in 1795 and 1806, 
> mass migrations collectively known as the Great Trek occurred 
> during which the Voortrekkers established several Boer Republics in the interior of South Africa. 
> 
> The discoveries of diamonds and gold in the nineteenth century had a profound effect on the fortunes of the region, 
> propelling it onto the world stage and introducing a shift 
> away from an exclusively agrarian-based economy towards industrialisation 
> and the development of urban infrastructure. 
> 
> The discoveries also led to new conflicts 
> culminating in open warfare between the Boer settlers and the British Empire, 
> fought for control over the nascent mining industry.
>
> Following the defeat of the Boers in the Second Anglo–Boer War or South African War (1899–1902), 
> the Union of South Africa was created as a self-governing dominion of the British Empire on 31 May 1910 
> in terms of the South Africa Act 1909, which amalgamated the four previously separate British colonies: 
> Cape Colony, Colony of Natal, Transvaal Colony, and Orange River Colony. 
> 
> The country became a fully sovereign nation state within the British Empire in 1934 
> following enactment of the Status of the Union Act. 
> The monarchy came to an end on 31 May 1961, replaced by a republic as the consequence of a 1960 referendum.
>
> From 1948–1994, South African politics was dominated by Afrikaner nationalism. 
> A comprehensive system of racial segregation and white minority rule known as 
> apartheid was introduced from 1948.
>
> On 2 February 1990, F. W. de Klerk, then president of South Africa and leader of the National Party, 
> unbanned the African National Congress (ANC) and freed Nelson Mandela from life imprisonment on Robben Island. 
> The CODESA talks negotiated the creation of a new non-racial democratic South Africa, 
> for which de Klerk and Mandela were later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
>
> These negotiations led to the creation of a democratic constitution for all South Africa. 
> On 27 April 1994, after decades of ANC-led resistance to white minority rule 
> and international opposition to apartheid, the ANC achieved a majority in the country's first democratic election. 
> Since then, despite a continually decreasing electoral majority, the ANC has ruled South Africa. 
> 
> In 2024, the ANC lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since the transition to democracy.
>
> High rates of crime, corruption, unemployment, low economic growth, an ongoing energy crisis, 
> and poorly maintained infrastructure are some of the problems challenging contemporary South Africa.
